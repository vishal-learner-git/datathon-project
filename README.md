# 📊 DATATHON Hackathon Project

## 🚀 Overview

This project was developed during a hackathon to solve real-world data challenges using data analytics, visualization, and intelligent insights. The system processes raw datasets, extracts meaningful patterns, and presents results in an easy-to-understand format.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many organizations struggle to derive actionable insights from large volumes of raw data. This project aims to:

* Clean and preprocess raw data
* Analyze patterns and trends
* Generate insights for decision-making
* Visualize results through dashboards or charts

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python / JavaScript *(edit if needed)*
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn *(edit based on your project)*
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
* **Other:** Machine Learning models *(if applicable)*

## 🔥 Key Features

* ✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing
* ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* ✔ Insight generation from datasets
* ✔ Interactive or static data visualizations
* ✔ Predictive analysis *(if ML used)*
